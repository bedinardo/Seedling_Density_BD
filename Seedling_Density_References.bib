	abstract = {Climate change is projected to significantly affect the vulnerability of forests across the western United States to wildfires, insects, disease, and droughts. Here, we provide recent mortality estimates for large trees for 53 species across 48 ecological sections using an analysis of 23,215 Forest Inventory plots and a Random Forest classification model. Models were also used to predict mortality in future FIA inventories under the RCP 4.5 emissions scenario. Model performance indicated species identity as the most important predictor of mortality under both current and future scenarios, with contributions from climate and soil variables. Our results show relatively high levels of recent mortality in the Middle and Southern Rocky Mountains driven by high mortality in Populus tremuloides, Pinus contorta, Pinus albicaulis, and Abies lasiocarpa. Low levels of mortality were observed in several species, with {\textless}1\% annual mortality observed throughout all other sections. Future mortality was predicted to increase significantly for most species and correlated well with recent mortality at the species level, but not at the plot level. These results suggest that future attempts to model or predict widespread forest mortality would benefit from more research on vulnerable species and that significant mortality events in some species may not be important for dynamics across all systems.},

We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15\% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

Location The dry domain of the western United States. Methods Using data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis National Program, we quantified the relationship between probability of occurrence and climate for adults and seedlings of each species with a Bayesian logistic regression. Assuming that distributional differences between life stages highlight shifting regeneration patterns relative to adult trees, we assessed differences between seedlings and adult trees based on predicted probabilities of occurrence and climate envelope boundaries. Results Differences between occurrence probabilities for seedlings and adults were greatest for montane, as opposed to subalpine, species and along range margins, especially in the southern and western portions of the study area. Climate envelope boundaries of seedlings differed from adult trees most frequently in montane species and often suggested range contractions or range shifts, as opposed to range expansion. Main conclusions Our results indicated that climate-induced contractions and shifts in seedling distribution in response to recent change are already under way and are particularly severe in montane tree species. While adult trees may persist for hundreds of years without significant regeneration, tree species ranges will eventually contract where tree regeneration fails.},

	abstract = {As climate changes in coming decades, ponderosa pine forest persistence may be increasingly dictated by their regeneration. Sustained regeneration failure has been predicted for forests of the southwestern US (SWUS) even in absence of stand-replacing wildfire, but regeneration in undisturbed and lightly disturbed forests has been studied infrequently and at a limited number of locations. We characterized 77 ponderosa pine sites in 7 SWUS locations, documented regeneration occurring over the past ∼20 years, and utilized gridded meteorological estimates and water balance modeling to determine the climate and environmental conditions associated with regeneration failure (R0). Of these sites, 29\% were R0, illuminating that regeneration failure in these forests is widespread. R0 sites were distinguished by high above- and belowground heat loading, loss of cool-season climate, and high soil moisture variation. Explanatory variables had high accuracy in identifying R0 sites, and illustrate the climate-driven pathway by which regeneration failure has occurred in the SWUS. Regeneration failure has high potential to increase in a warmer, more hydrologically variable climate, and expand regionally from lower to higher latitudes. Yet, we also found that human management interventions were associated with environmental conditions that avoided regeneration failure. To counteract regeneration-associated forest declines, interventions will need to influence climate-driven environmental change by adjusting forest characteristics at local scales. Regeneration failures are a major threat to ponderosa pine forest persistence, and they have potential to intensify and expand in a changing climate.},

	abstract = {Tree regeneration is a critical mechanism of forest resilience to stand-replacing wildfire (i.e., where fire results in {\textgreater}90 \% tree mortality), and post-fire regeneration is a concern worldwide as the climate becomes warmer. Although post-fire tree regeneration has been relatively well-studied in fire-prone forests across western North America, it is less understood in fire regimes characterized by large patches of stand-replacing fire at long intervals, such as the nominally infrequent, high-severity fire regimes of the western Cascades of Washington and northern Oregon, USA (northwestern Cascadia) where some of world’s highest-biomass forests reside. Recent wildfire activity (2015–2020) in northwestern Cascadia provides a unique opportunity to build understanding of the mechanisms underpinning forest resilience to fire, with implications for forest management and the myriad socio-ecological values associated with these landscapes. Here, we asked: how is post-fire conifer regeneration across northwestern Cascadia affected by pre-fire stand age, burn-patch size, and topo-climatic conditions? We established 39 1-ha long-term monitoring plots across four recent wildfires in northwestern Cascadia to measure post-fire conifer abundance and species composition. We used generalized linear models to test how rates of conifer regeneration (seedlings ha 1 yr 1 of all heights) and establishment (seedlings ha 1 yr 1 with heights {\textgreater}10 cm) respond to differences in pre-fire stand age/seral stage (young, mid-seral, late-seral), distance to the nearest live seed source, and post-fire topo-climate setting. In general, initial post-fire seedling densities suggest tree regeneration is abundant following stand-replacing fire in most areas across the region. For example, at 3–5 years post-fire, established seedlings were present in 100 \% of plots, and regeneration and establishment levels exceeded state forest practices minimum density thresholds (470 seedlings ha 1) in 82.1 \% and 64.1 \% of plots, respectively. Post-fire conifer regeneration and tree species richness were greater when pre-fire stand age was older, and was more dominated by shade tolerant species than when pre-fire stand age was younger. Regeneration decreased with farther distances to the nearest live seed source, though seedlings were still moderately abundant at distances as far as 400 m from edges of high-severity patches. Conifer establishment was greater in areas characterized by cooler and wetter macrosite (e.g., greater post-fire precipitation) and microsite (e.g., greater bryophyte ground cover) conditions. By providing information on the drivers and conditions in which land managers can expect natural regeneration to occur or not, our findings are directly relevant to pre- and postfire forest management objectives under future climate and increased fire activity in systems structured in part by infrequent and severe wildfires.},

	abstract = {Strong but relatively short (annual to decadal length) climate change can have broad-scale and long-lasting effects on forest communities. Climate impacts forests through direct effects on tree demography (mortality and overstory recruitment) and indirect effects on disturbance regimes. Here, we compare multicentury chronologies of tree recruitment from a 307-ha ponderosa pine forest in southwestern Colorado to reconstructions of fire years, hydroclimate, and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Few trees predate a regional multiyear megadrought centered in the 1580s. A prolonged pluvial in the early1600s resulted in a pulse of tree recruitment that corresponds to recruitment seen over much of the Southwest. Other cohorts in the early 1700s and mid-1800s established during multidecadal fire-quiescent periods. These periods correspond to shifts in ENSO that apparently resulted in dampening of interannual wet/dry oscillations responsible for fuel buildup and drying. Fires, mediated by stochastic climate variation, acted as a density-independent regulation on tree populations since establishment was not limited by overstory tree density, but rather by fire-caused mortality of seedlings and saplings during periods of more frequent fires. Even-aged cohorts in ponderosa pine forests likely have little if anything to do with episodic mortality caused by more severe fires, but rather relate mainly to episodic recruitment opportunities. Fire cessation after Euro-American settlement in the late 1800s resulted in an increase in tree density and changes in forest composition, which are major factors that have contributed to recent severe wildfires in other Southwestern forests. Our results document clear linkages between synoptic climate forcing, fires, and recruitment episodes, and highlight the importance of regional historical processes on contemporary forest composition and structure.},

	abstract = {Anticipating the next generation of forests requires understanding of recruitment responses to habitat change. Tree distribution and abundance depend not only on climate, but also on habitat variables, such as soils and drainage, and on competition beneath a shaded canopy. Recent analyses show that North American tree species are migrating in response to climate change, which is exposing each population to novel climate-habitat interactions (CHI). Because CHI have not been estimated for either adult trees or regeneration (recruits per year per adult basal area), we cannot evaluate migration potential into the future. Using the Masting Inference and Forecasting (MASTIF) network of tree fecundity and new continent-wide observations of tree recruitment, we quantify impacts for redistribution across life stages from adults to fecundity to recruitment. We jointly modeled response of adult abundance and recruitment rate to climate/habitat conditions, combined with fecundity sensitivity, to evaluate if shifting CHI explain community reorganization. To compare climate effects with tree fecundity, which is estimated from trees and thus is "conditional" on tree presence, we demonstrate how to quantify this conditional status for regeneration. We found that fecundity was regulated by temperature to a greater degree than other stages, yet exhibited limited responses to moisture deficit. Recruitment rate expressed strong sensitivities to CHI, more like adults than fecundity, but still with substantial differences. Communities reorganized from adults to fecundity, but there was a re-coalescence of groups as seedling recruitment partially reverted to community structure similar to that of adults. Results provide the first estimates of continent-wide community sensitivity and their implications for reorganization across three life-history stages under climate change.},

	abstract = {Invasion by generalist tree species can cause biotic homogenization, and such community impoverishment is likely more important in rare forest types. We quantified changes in tree diversity within Carolinian (range in Central Hardwood Forest), central (range in Central Hardwood Forest and Northern Hardwood-Conifer Forest), and northern species [range reached Northern-Conifer-Hardwood/closed Boreal (spruce-Fir) Forest] in an old forest tract in southern Canada at points surveyed 24 years apart. We asked: How did mature tree and sapling composition and abundance change for the three species’ groups? Did those changes lead to biotic homogenization? Can species’ changes be explained by community traits? We tested for differences in temporal and spatial tree β-diversity, as well as forest composition and structure, using univariate/multivariate analyses and a community trait-based approach to identify drivers of change. Major increases occurred in abundance for mature Acer rubrum (northern), while other species decreased (Fraxinus americana, Populus grandidentata); declines were found in A. saccharinum (central) and Cornus florida (Carolinian). Species composition of saplings, but not mature trees, changed due to replacement; no evidence for biotic homogenization existed in either cohort. As a group, northern mature tree species increased significantly, while central species decreased; saplings of pooled Carolinian species also declined. Shade tolerance in mature trees increased, reflecting successional changes, while drought tolerance decreased, perhaps due to changing temperatures, altered precipitation or ground water levels. Saplings showed declines in all traits, probably because of compositional change. Our results demonstrated that saplings can more closely reflect change in forest dynamics than mature trees, especially over short time periods. Based on sapling trends, this remnant could ultimately transition to a mesophytic hardwood stand dominated by A. rubrum and other shade-tolerant species, creating a more homogeneous forest. While encouraging regeneration for Carolinian and central tree species could ensure high levels of diversity are conserved in the future, it is important to balance this with the primary management goal of maintaining the forest's old-growth characteristics.},

	abstract = {Density dependence could maintain diversity in forests, but studies continue to disagree on its role. Part of the disagreement results from the fact that different studies have evaluated different responses (survival, recruitment, or growth) of different stages (seeds, seedlings, or adults) to different inputs (density of seedlings, density or distance to adults). Most studies are conducted on a single site and thus are difficult to generalize. Using USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis data, we analyzed over a million seedling-to-sapling recruitment observations of 50 species from the eastern United States, controlling for the effects of climate. We focused on the per-seedling recruitment rate, because it is most likely to promote diversity and to be identified in observational or experimental data. To understand the prevalence of density dependence, we quantified the number of species with significant positive or negative effects. To understand the strength of density dependence, we determined the magnitude of effects among con- and heterospecifics, and how it changes with overall species abundance. We found that density dependence is pervasive among the 50 species, as the majority of them have significant effects and mostly negative. Density-dependence effects are stronger from conspecific than heterospecfic adult neighbors, consistent with the predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. Contrary to recent reports, density-dependence effects are more negative for common than rare species, suggesting disproportionately stronger population regulation in common species. We conclude that density dependence is pervasive, and it is strongest from conspecific neighbors of common species. Our analysis provides direct evidence that density dependence regulates population dynamics of tree species in eastern U.S. forests.},

	abstract = {Landscape-scale ecological modelling has been hindered by suitable high-resolution surface meteorological datasets. To overcome these limitations, desirable spatial attributes of gridded climate data are combined with desirable temporal attributes of regional-scale reanalysis and daily gauge-based precipitation to derive a spatially and temporally complete, high-resolution (4-km) gridded dataset of surface meteorological variables required in ecological modelling for the contiguous United States from 1979 to 2010. Validation of the resulting gridded surface meteorological data, using an extensive network of automated weather stations across the western United States, showed skill comparable to that derived from interpolation using station observations, suggesting it can serve as suitable surrogate for landscape-scale ecological modelling across vast unmonitored areas of the United States.
