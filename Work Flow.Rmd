# Climatic drivers of Oregon Seedling Density 

**By Bryce DiNardo**

## Literature review (~5 paragraphs)

### Paragraph 1 — Problem & significance (big‑picture reviews)
…

### Paragraph 2–3 — Past work & data landscape (who/where/how; gaps)
…

### Paragraph 4 — Purpose & why now
…

### Paragraph 5 — Hypotheses (directional) & brief rationale
- H1: … (I predict … because …)
- H2: …

## Dataset identification
- Dataset A (URL/DOI): collector, methods, columns/units …
- OBA → transformed to … (plan and rationale) …

## Workflow plan (prose)
1) Cleaning & validation: …  
2) Aggregations/derivations: …  
3) Functions/loops (inputs → outputs): …  
4) Statistical test + programmatic implementation: …  
5) Planned visualizations/tables: …  
6) Risks & mitigations: …

In pros, please describe the workflow you will use tidy your raw data, manipulate and summarize it in relevant ways, test you hypothesis, and visualize it.The goal here is to develop a logic to your workflow before you code.

Include any needed cleaning steps (e.g., “remove non-species such as ‘fly’ from the species column”)
Include any aggregation steps (e.g., “count the number of entries by region and year to calculate species richness”).
Include descriptions of any functions/for loops you will write.
Include a description the the statistical test you will use, and how you will apply it programatically (i.e., I will simulate the null hypothesis by shuffling the labels…“)

**Cleaning and processing FIA data**
Import all OR FIA data using rFIA 
Extract Seedling tree per arch (TPA) for each year of data wanted. 
Do this by using rFIA seedling function, I want to seedling density groupby plot, returnSPatial == TRUE, and bySpecies.
This will give me the TPA for each species in each plot and have then in an Oregon polygon. Not sure yet if I need to provide a shp file for that yet, but easy enough if so.

Now I have a bunch of seedling densities, sorted by plot and species
*Next lets filter to clean some data*
Filter for only forest plots (PLOT_STATUS_CD == 1)
Remove TPA NAs and 0 values or "unknown" 
Remove sites with missing Lat or Long values
Filter for year wanted(2013 - 2022 one complete inventory cycle of most recent)

Great now we have cleaned seedling density for all species that occur in each plot throughout the state in that given year this is our *responds variable*

##Work Flow
#Part 1: FIA data aquistion and processing
**Load packages**
install.packages("rFIA")
library("rFIA")
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")

**Data aquistion**
Get all FIA data for Oregon by using rFIA
```{r}
options(timeout = 600) #Need to increase download time since file is so large
#Grab the data
OR <- getFIA(states = 'OR', dir = "C:/Users/dinardo/OneDrive - University Of Oregon/FIA", load = FALSE) #Install the data
OR <- readFIA(dir = "C:/Users/dinardo/OneDrive - University Of Oregon/FIA",
              states = 'OR',
              nCores = 1,
              inMemory = TRUE)
```
