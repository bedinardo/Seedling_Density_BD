##Climatic drivers of Oregon Seedling Density

**By Bryce DiNardo**

**Introduction**

For forests to maintain their structure and function, successful regeneration of existing species at similar densities is essential. Shifts in seedling species compositions can signal a change in the forest community structure, such as a succession change towards a shade tolerant old-growth away from a shade-intolerant new growth forest (@kirk_changes_2021). These shifts can be seen early in changes in seedling density, which is a measure of recruitment strength and an early indicator of whether a stand can replace its canopy. Low or declining densities signal potential regeneration failure and reduced future structural complexity, while cohort pulses of very high density alter competition and future mortality patterns (@johnson_conspecific_2012; @zhu_prevalence_2015). Contemporary shifts in climate have altered growing conditions relative to those under which many forests established, changing the window of conditions that allow seedlings and saplings to survive and grow (@brown_climate_2005). Seedlings and saplings are more sensitive to these climate changes than mature trees, resulting in current climatic conditions strongly influencing recruitment success and the future composition of forests (@qiu_niche_2021; @bell_early_2014). This climatic filtering interacts with increasing disturbance pressure—particularly wildfire—to determine which species can reestablish after canopy‑opening events and which populations face regeneration failure, making species density a practical metric for managers prioritizing seed‑source protection or assisted regeneration (@laughlin_patterns_2023; @petrie_widespread_2023).

Past research shows that climate, disturbance, and local biotic interactions jointly shape regeneration, but their relative importance varies by scale, species, and region. Petrie et al. (2023) found that climatic and environmental conditions strongly predict regeneration failure in ponderosa pine, with sustained high air temperatures and rising winter minima linked to widespread recruitment collapse. Other studies demonstrate that climatic niches for adults, fecundity, and recruits can diverge, so adult distributions do not reliably predict recruitment success under contemporary conditions (@bell_early_2014; @qiu_niche_2021). Dendroecological work ties episodic recruitment pulses to wet periods and shows reduced establishment during droughts or sustained warming, implying that canopy opening alone will not guarantee successful regeneration when post‑disturbance climates are unfavorable (@brown_climate_2005). Post‑fire and regional field studies further identify seed‑source proximity, pre‑fire stand age, and cooler, wetter microsites as strong enhancers of early conifer regeneration, while warming and drying increase the risk of failure (@laughlin_patterns_2023). On a more local scale, conspecific negative density dependence and density-dependent interactions between seedlings, as well as between seedlings and mature trees, play a critical role in regulating forest population dynamics. In denser, more common species, stronger intraspecific competition helps maintain ecosystem diversity (@johnson_conspecific_2012; @zhu_prevalence_2015). Consequently, local species abundance patterns, climate, and disturbance regimes interact to shape seedling density—and ultimately influence future forest composition and structure.

Many studies have examined seedling-to-sapling transitions or other recruitment metrics, often focusing on a single species (@petrie_widespread_2023) or a specific region following disturbance—typically fire—using long-term field data collected over a decade or more (@laughlin_patterns_2023). While these studies offer valuable insights, they are often difficult to replicate or too narrowly scoped to inform broader forest management decisions, especially for local and state land managers. Some researchers have addressed reproducibility challenges by using publicly available data from the U.S. Forest Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, a nationwide forest monitoring effort that provides standardized measurements across space and time. FIA plots are resurveyed every 5 to 10 years, with consistent data collection protocols that include tree species, plot identifiers, and seedling counts. Although previous studies have used FIA data to examine seedling dynamics, they often aggregate across multiple plots (@johnson_conspecific_2012) or rely on derived metrics rather than the straightforward seedling density (trees per hectare) which can be calculated from the database (@qiu_niche_2021). To my knowledge, no studies have used this off-the-shelf seedling density metric in a simple, reproducible way as I do here. Additionally, while many prior studies incorporate PRISM climate data for spatial modeling, PRISM—though highly accurate—is less modular than GridMET, which offers daily resolution and customizable temporal scales while still incorporating PRISM’s spatial interpolation (@abatzoglou_development_2013). Finally, although most reviewed studies explore changes in forest composition in response to climate, disturbance, or density, none explicitly include land ownership as a predictor, and few consider whether climatic variables act as consistent drivers of seedling diversity or density over time.

As climate conditions continue to shift across the United States, it is increasingly important for land managers to understand whether these changes are affecting seedling recruitment and, by extension, forest composition and structure. Therefore it is imperative to identify the primary drivers behind any observed shifts, whether they stem from climatic variables or land management practices. By using publicly available data sources such as FIA derived seedling density, land ownership classifications, and annual climate variables from GridMET, I evaluate how climate and ownership shape seedling density across Oregon forests over time. Through species and year specific random forest models, I predict seedling density (seedlings per hectare) for a subset of ecologically and economically important tree species. This approach provides reproducible insight into whether Oregon’s forests are shifting, whether those shifts are driven by climate or land ownership, and if these drivers are consistent across years. By integrating ownership and climate predictors in a modular framework, I provide an accessible tool for understanding recruitment dynamics across diverse forest contexts.


### Paragraph 5 — Hypotheses (directional) & brief rationale
- H1: I predict annual precipitation and mean temperature will be the most impactful climate drivers of seedling density across species and years. This prediction is based on prior studies showing that these climate variables strongly influence seedling recruitment, establishment success, and early survival across a range of forest types.

- H2: I predict the importance of climate variables in explaining seedling density will be greater in years with extreme climate conditions and lower in years with near-average conditions because in more extreme climate years, climate becomes a limiting variable to growth and recruitment leading to more predictive power in the model for extreme years. 

-H3:Hypothesis: I predict that the influence of landownership on seedling density will remain consistent across years, reflecting stable management practices and recurring environmental conditions. Because landowners often apply similar treatments, disturbance regimes, or access restrictions year after year, their impact on recruitment dynamics is expected to be temporally stable.




## Datasets 

**FIA**

FIA database, accessed using rFIA (ownership data too but not primary spot to get right now) (https://research.fs.usda.gov/products/dataandtools/fia-datamart) Data comes in a number of different tables, all consisting of a CN number that can be used to connect plots to different attributes measured in those plots and conditions within and across. Col are often variables and rows are values per an individual (TREE) or species (SEEDLING)

**Climate**

Climatology Lab gridMET data, accessed through amadeus package comes in .nc files (https://www.climatologylab.org/gridmet.html), these .nc get processed as spat raster layer stack at 4km res with each layer is a raster of the USA where each pixel is a value for the climate condition of interest 

**Landownwer**
Landowner, provide by Melissa as a .shp file for state of OR 
OR shp file for masking, from sf package. 

##Workflow plan

**Cleaning and processing FIA data**

Import all OR FIA data using rFIA 
Extract Seedling tree per archer (TPA) for each year of data wanted. 
Do this by using rFIA seedling function, I want to seedling density groupby plot, returnSPatial == TRUE, and bySpecies.
This will give me the TPA for each species in each plot and have then in an Oregon polygon.

Now I have a bunch of seedling densities, sorted by plot and species

*Next lets filter to clean some data*

Filter for only forest plots (PLOT_STATUS_CD == 1)
Filter for only target speceis
Filter for each plot CN only showing up once
Remove TPA NAs and 0 values or "unknown" 
Remove sites with missing Lat or Long values
Filter for year wanted(2014 - 2022 one complete inventory cycle of most recent)

*Function and loops*

Write a function that take year and seedling species as an input, and uses all of the previous steps to create a raster of seedling density at all plots measure in that year for a single species and recreate a raster.

Now create a loop that loops through all target years and all target species, ending with a bunch of different rasters for each year, and within each year density at all plots look at each target species. 

Make sure crs matches climate and landowner data (WGS 1984, lat long)


Great now we have cleaned seedling density for all target species that occur in each plot throughout the state in for a given year this is our responds variable

**Climate Data Acquisition, Cleaning and Calculation**

Climate data will be download from GridMAT using using the download_data function from the amadeus package.

Each download will be for a specific year and climatic variable. The three main once I will get is Minimum Near-Surface Air Temperature, Maximum Near-Surface Air Temperature, and precipitation. From the function will be a downloaded .nc file, ready to be processed. 
list.files() will be used to make sure download succeeded and to check the correct directory name to be used in the next step. 

Once acquire I will have a function that takes which ever variable and does the following.

Inputs: year, climate variable, and directory
Output: yearly mean raster data with the Oregon vector. Then there is an if statement, where if the variable is either Minimum Near-Surface Air Temperature or Maximum Near-Surface Air Temperature. Or annual precip

Processes the covariates using the process_covariates function, then get a shp file for Oregon using tirgirs library, re-object the Oregon shp to the same crs as the rasters that come from process_covariates. Then crop and mask the raster data with the Oregon vector. Then there is an if statement, where if the variable is either Minimum Near-Surface Air Temperature or Maximum Near-Surface Air Temperature, then terra::mean is used to calculate the mean max and min yearly temperature, outputting a single raster, with the units in C, and then saving it as a .TIF. If the variable is precipitation, then sum is used to calculate annual rainfall, single raster download and saved as .TIF

I will also have a temperature mean function, that simply takes the outputs from the max and min temperature variables and computes a yearly average temperature.

This will be done for all years of interest, 2022-2014 (matches the survey time frame of the last fully completed FIA survey)

To validate the successful completion of data process, I will used: class(result), nlyr(result)
terra::plot(result)
summary(values(result))
To make sure the data type is as expected, is the expected number of raster layers, it plots as expect, and values are within a reasonable range. 

**Landowner**

My advisor will provide me a vector shp with landowner that is geo referenced, convert vector to raster, match crs with climate data, save as raster. 

##Testsing 

To test the null hypothesis that my predictor variables have no relationship with seedling density, I use a permutation-based variable importance approach within the random forest framework. Using the ranger package, I assess each predictor by randomly shuffling its values and measuring the resulting increase in prediction error. A larger increase in error indicates greater importance, suggesting that the predictor contributes meaningfully to explaining variation in the response variable.
  
**Statistical tests**

Now that I have assembled my predictor variables — minimum temperature (tmmn), maximum temperature (tmmx), mean temperature (tmean), annual precipitation (precip), and landowner category — for each year, and my response variable — seedling density for each species and year — I can begin modeling. The goal is to evaluate whether climate and landownership can predict seedling density patterns across Oregon.

*Base training Overview*

To begin, I will fit a random forest regression model using the ranger package, focusing on Douglas-fir seedling density in 2022

*Responds variable*

I start by preparing the response variable: the density of Douglas-fir seedlings recorded at FIA plots in Oregon during 2022. I load the raster I previously generated from FIA data and use either terra::extract() or as.data.frame() to convert it into a plot-level data frame. This data frame includes seedling density values and the corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates for each plot.

*Predictor variables*

Next, I load the climate and landowner rasters for 2022. Since all data layers are georeferenced (typically in WGS 1984 latitude-longitude), I can extract raster pixel values that correspond to each FIA plot location. These values are stored in a data frame with plot IDs and predictor variables.

To do this, I convert my FIA raster into a vector of spatial points — one point per plot — using terra::as.points() or a similar function. This allows me to overlay the plot points onto the climate and landowner rasters and extract values at those exact locations. If needed, I reproject the rasters or vector data to ensure all layers share a common CRS.

Training Data Frame complete

At this point, I have a complete training data frame. Each row represents a plot, and columns include: the respond variable (seed density), and predictor variable. all as numeric

*Ready to run random forest regression model*

Training data is ready to role, I can now use the ranger package to fit a random forest regession model to my data. 

Since this is a random item make sure I set.seed.
Then I can use the ranger function to fit the model. Based on online documentation on ranger I will set the  importance metric to "permutation" to obtain unbiased variable importance scores, and use scale.permutation.importance = TRUE to match the scaling used in traditional random forest implementations. (uses 500 trees, with three random predictors at each split)

Hopefully I won't get an error

*Model Evaluation and goodness of fit*

After fitting the model, I assess its performance using out-of-bag (OOB) metrics provided by ranger, including R² (Indicates the proportion of variance in seedling density explained by the model) and root mean squared error (RMSE) (Quantifies the average prediction error in original units). 
These metrics provide a baseline for how well climate and landownership explain variation
I will also plot the OOB cross-validation predictions

*Variable importance*

To interpret the model, I extract variable importance scores using ranger::importance() and visualize them using the vip package. Revealing which predictor most strongly influenced seedling density patterns for that species and year window

*Auto mating for all combination*

Great, I have run a random forest analysis for a single year/sp combo. Lets make some functions and run a loop to get all data for all years and sp combos 

*Functions*

One
Build function for training data frame
Inputs: seedling raster, climate rasters (4 of them seperate or as a list in a single), landowner raster.

Output: training dataframe from that year sp combo

Two
function for running ranger

input: training data frame
output: Model

Three
Model eval
input: model, training data frame
output: rmse, r2m, importance, OOB cross-validation predictions plot 

Four
Variable importance 
input: model
Output: graph variables level of importance

*Do it for all*

With all the function made, and hopefully all bugs fixed, I will loop over all sp/yr combos using these functions. Storing my results in a structured list, including fitted models, evaluation metrics, training data, and variable importance. 

**Visualizations**

 *Model fit*
 
To evaluate model performance, I generate scatterplots of out-of-bag (OOB) predictions versus observed seedling densities for each species-year model. These plots include a 1:1 reference line and are used to visually assess model accuracy, bias, and spread. They complement quantitative metrics such as R² and RMSE. I will have to do this will all of the forest I run with each sp/year combo, however, I will select only the interesting and or good representative once for my poster

Function
inputs: OOB, seedling density, year
Out: scatterplot

Loop through all sp/year combos 

*Variable importance visualization*

To interpret which predictors most strongly influenced seedling density, I extract permutation-based variable importance scores from each fitted random forest model. I visualize these scores using horizontal bar plots, highlighting the top predictors for each species-year combination. Nice way to see for everyone what was important. I will also color it in a way where climate predictor will be visually different from landowner

*Synthesis across species and years*

To explore broader patterns, I aggregate variable importance scores across all models and visualize them using, a heat map table, with species in the rows and year in column and greatest predictor at the values, and have the color coded to really pop! Then some line plots. Showing how the importance of specific predictors change over time for a specific species. Lastly use box plot to see what top predictors were consists and which ones only matter a lot a few times.

*Map*

An awesome map of a species that has an interesting result (variation in of predictors over years), where I have a map of OR with each plot location on it. The symbol of the plot location will be whatever the great predictor was, the color will correspond to year, and the size of the symbol will correspond to predictor’s importance. OOO and maybe have national forest/state forest boundaries and ecoregions. This might be too much but I will play around with it. 

*Prediction driven visuals* 

H1: Heat map table works for H1 seeing how often precip and tmean show up as top predictors 

H2: Line chart of climate variable average values across all plots for each year, and then points on the line by color or size relating predictor strength 

H3: Box plots assess the temporal consistency of landownership importance across years.

I know that this is a lot, especially considering multiple species, I might have to cut back but hopefully will be able to write function to automate a lot of the process to save time. I will also focus my energy on visualizing the more exciting and important data. 


**Risks and Mitigation**

*FIA*

Lots of risks with FIA data, number one is missing or incomplete data for seedling count. This could lead to some bias in training for that year, not using all the data that could be present. Not a ton you can do about missing data other than omit NAs and do quailty checks

Moreover with FIA. Big risk with unevenly distributed data collection across private, state, and federal lands. This could really impact the importance of landownership as a predictor. To mitigate, track sample sizes by ownership class, and interpret with this important caviot in mind. Also on the same line with landowner, some FIA plots lat longs are fuzzed, so this could throw off climate data, however the fuzzing should be done in a representative way of the actually place the plot are taken, hopefully not throwing off climate data too much. Plus fuzzing is normally about a change within 1km of actually site location and climate data is 4 km res.

*Climate*

I could and likely will have a temporal mismatch between climate and recruitment. Where a sort of lag effect might exist, if I had more time I could use multi year climate averages. But for this project I think I just need to acknowledge this limitation.
